        <h3>Ingridients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
            <li>Half teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
            <li>Three-quarters teaspoon salt, divided</li>
            <li>Four (1-inch thick) boneless pork loin chops</li>
            <li>Quarter cup olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>Half onion, cut thinly into half-moons</li>
            <li>One red apple - unpeeled, cored, and sliced into quarter-inch-thick wedges</li>
            <li>One cup reduced-sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>One teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <LI>Four cups lightly packed, coarsely chopped kale</LI>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place fennel seeds and peppercorns in a small zip-top plastic bag</li>
            <li>Seal bag and pound spices using a mallet or rolling pin until coarsely ground, or pulse them briefly in a spice or coffee grinder</li>
            <li>Sprinkle mixture and 1/4 teaspoon salt on both sides of chops</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large, high-sided skillet over medium heat</li>
            <li>Add sweet potatoes; cook, stirring occasionally, until fork-tender, 10 to 12 minutes</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt, then transfer to a plate</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat</li>
            <li>Add chops and reduce heat to medium; cook, turning once, about 4 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest parts registers 145 degrees F (63 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Transfer chops to a plate and tent with foil</li>
            <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and the onion to the skillet; cook until onion softens, about 2 minutes</li>
            <li>Add apple; cook 1 minute more. Add broth, stirring to scrape up browned bits, then stir in mustard and sweet potatoes</li>
            <li>Increase heat to medium-high; simmer until apple is slightly softened and liquid has slightly reduced, 1 to 2 minutes</li>
            <li>Add kale and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until kale is tender, about 1 minute</li>
            <li>Add any accumulated juices from the plate with pork. Serve chops with vegetable mixture</li>
        </ol>
